"""Append-only, hash-chained audit log for lease lifecycle events.

Every successful allocate / renew / release / expire / resize appends
exactly one event, inside the same ``BEGIN IMMEDIATE`` transaction as the
state change itself — so a rolled-back operation never leaves an event
behind.

Each event stores ``seq`` (1, 2, 3, ...), the action, lease/pool ids, the
CIDR, the event time, a JSON ``details`` object, ``prev_hash`` and ``hash``.
The first event's ``prev_hash`` is 64 zeros; every later event chains to the
previous event's ``hash``. ``hash`` is::

    SHA-256( prev_hash_text || canonical_json(all fields except prev_hash/hash) )

where the canonical JSON is UTF-8, keys sorted, compact separators.
